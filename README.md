I am a recent graduate of Tufts University, where I studied Computer Science and Political Science. 
I am seeking for opportunities to develop a mission-driven career in Data Science and Software Engineering.  
In particular, I am interested in applying quantitative methods and using data to better understand and solve 
political, social, and public health issues.
This repository includes files for a number of projects I have worked on over the past few years.

At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA I worked on a project to explore ways of making the emergency room 
more efficient. I developed a simulation of the ER using Python's SimPy package that reproduced the process of a patient
going through each step of the ER. The project is in the file ed_simulation_tkinter.py.

In my Machine Learning course, I implemented a Naive Bayes classifier that classified Amazon, IMDB, and Yelp reviews. 
The code includes plots for results. The project is in the file naive_bayes_project.py. 

Also in my Machine Learning course, I implemented the SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression classifiers to
correctly classify data from two datasets. The first was hypothetical data about individuals on the Titantic
and if they survived. There were a number of features and the subsequent label if they survived or not. The second
dataset included hypothetical pixel data on a doctor's handwriting which then labeled the writing as either an eight
or a nine. This project is in the files titanic.py and mnist.py.

In my Machine Structure and Assembly Language course, I implemented an image compressor and decompressor in C. It takes in
PPM images and transforms the color space by packing and unpacking the binary data. This project is in the Arith branch.

In my Data Structure course, I implemented a program in C++ to connect students and TAs from different courses. It reads in data 
about each person, and then retrieves information from that data. It can print the student names, the courses, the courses
a certain person TAed, the roster of a certain class, all paths between two people, and the shortest path between two people. 
This project is in the Data_structures-final branch.
