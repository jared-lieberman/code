This repository contains code that implements the random forest classifier
for New York City taxi data. It uses csv files from the Taxi & Limousine
Commission website to read in rides from January 2018. Using this data, it
predicts which borough a ride will finish in.

The millions of rides are initially processed in read_in_data.py.

The exploratory data analysis is performed in exploratory_analysis.py, which
creates a table with matplotlib.

The actual models are created in random_forest_classifier.py.
